# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created as an exercise to better understand some of the concepts introduced in the coding bootcamp.  While it represents my personal documentation of the most important information encountered throughout the precourse work, it will be useful to all bootcamp students.

The topics documented are:
CSS
Git
HTML
JavaScript

## Usage

There are notes in each section highlighting some of the more important information relevant to our studies.  Functions have been built-into the application to aid in suggestions.  To access the suggestions, the Dev Tools available through Google Chrome can be used.  Right-clicking the page and selecting the option "Inspect" will open the tools.  The keyboard shortcut Ctrl + Shift + I can also be used.  Clicking the console tab in the tools will utilize the built-in functions to suggest possible areas of study.
